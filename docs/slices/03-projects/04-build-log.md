Baseline before the first commit: `npm test` (typecheck, lint, test:unit, test:rules,
test:integration) and `npm run test:e2e` both green on `main` at `2deb1b7`.

## T1 — Project schemas

**Red:** `functions/src/projects/schema.spec.ts` — 52 cases across `projectsPath`,
`createProjectBodySchema`, `patchProjectBodySchema`, `projectIdSchema`,
`storedProjectSchema` and `toProject`. First run failed on the missing module, then on
nothing else.

**Green:** `functions/src/projects/schema.ts` exactly as the plan specifies — `PROJECTS`,
`NAME_MAX`, `DESCRIPTION_MAX`, `PROJECT_LIMIT`, `LIST_LIMIT`, `projectsPath(uid)` composed
from the imported `USERS`, the two `.strict()` body schemas, the id regex, the stored-document
schema with `.catch` on the three degradable fields only, and `toProject`.

**ACs:** AC-14, AC-15, AC-16, AC-17 (L1 half), AC-20 (stored half).

**Deviations from the plan:** none.

**Notes:**

- `storedProjectSchema` gained two cases the plan did not name: a blank `name` is rejected
  (a row with an empty title is as unrenderable as one with no title), and an absent
  `deletedAt` parses to `null` rather than failing, so a document written before the field
  existed reads as live rather than as unreadable. Both are `.catch`/`min` behaviour the
  plan already specified; the tests just pin them.
